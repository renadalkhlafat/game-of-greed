## Description:

- At the beginning each player throws 6 dice. After each throw player is required to set aside at least one or more scoring dice.
- After each throw player has to decide to either bank the points accumulated in the particular turn, or continue throwing the dice.
- If a player has scored all 6 dice (hot dice), they can again start with 6 dice and continue throwing and accumulating points for the turn.
- The player must have at least one scoring dice in each throw, otherwise they farkle and lose all points accumulated for the turn. It does not affect points accumulated in previous turns.
